Calculates the area of a circle given its radius
SaturdayLab1: Data types. Variables. Constants. 
Problem 4 
Write an interactive java program that accepts the radius of a circle from
 the user as input. The program computes and displays the area of the circle.
 Use a constant in the program. 
 Save the program as CircleArea.java.
 Hint: the formula to compute the area of a circle is:
 area = PI * radius * radius */

public class CircleArea {
	

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		//declare double radius
		double radius;
		
		//declare double PI
		final double PI = 3.14;
		
		//declare double area
		double area;
		
		//declare a variable of type Scanner
		Scanner sc;
		//create an object of type Scanner to take input via keyboard
		sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		//input
		System.out.println("Please enter radius are: ");
		radius = sc.nextDouble();
		//processing
		area = PI * radius * radius;
		//output
		System.out.println("The area of a circle with radius is: " + radius + " is " + area);
